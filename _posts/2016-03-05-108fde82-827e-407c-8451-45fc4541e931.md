**We-Consent**(tm) App Suite Pilot
Program Outline

During the Spring 2016 semester,
ISCE.edu and the pilot school will work to create a meaningful and effective
rollout program to be fully implemented during the Fall 2016 semester.

The **Spring 2016** semester effort: 

_a. Working to ensure that the app suite
functions as a complement to the pilot school's ongoing Title IX education and
compliance efforts._

_b. Identifying key student, faculty,
staff, and administration members to experiment with app suite and to develop
the appropriate "encourage downloading and use" messages for release at the
start of the Fall semester._

_c. Members of the ISCE.edu team will be
available to attend education and planning sessions at the pilot school._

_d. The technical people at both ISCE.edu
and at the pilot school will ensure that the global "abc@schoolname.edu" email
type address works in gaining access to the app suite._

_e. Developing appropriate tracking
measures to monitor both the uptake and the efficacy of the app suite._

_f. Developing responses to FAQs as they
may originate with students, faculty, staff, or administration members._

_g. Developing appropriate web pages and
print material which describe the Fall 2016 semester pilot program._

The **Fall 2016** semester effort:

_a. Giving each student at the pilot
school full access to the entire app suite._

_b. Members of the ISCE.edu team will be
available to attend education and uptake sessions at the pilot school._

_c. Monitoring uptake and use and
providing reports to the pilot school._

_d. Adjusting any of the Spring 2016 semester
efforts as needed or as requested by the pilot school._

_e. Assisting the pilot school with
evaluation and report preparation as may be desired._

Both the Spring and Fall 2016 semester
efforts will be undertaken by ISCE.edu at no cost to the pilot school other
than reimbursement of travel costs for ISCE.edu staff to attend education or
planning meetings at the pilot school.

This is a general outline and can be
modified as desired.
